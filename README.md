# spring-boot-backend-project
This repository contains a backend application developed while completing a Spring Boot course. The project focuses on building RESTful web services using modern Java, Spring Boot, and database integration.

**Overview**

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with enterprise-level backend development using the Spring ecosystem. It demonstrates how to design REST APIs, connect to databases, and structure a scalable Java application.

**Features**

- RESTful API development with Spring Boot
- CRUD operations for data entities
- Integration with relational database
- Spring Data JPA and Hibernate ORM
- Layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Exception handling and validation
- Maven-based project structure

**Tech Stack**
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- REST APIs
- Maven
- MySQL (or H2 depending on your project)

**Project Structure**
src/main/java
- controller  # REST controllers
- service     # Business logic
- repository  # Data access layer
- entity      # Database models

**What I Learned**
- How to build and structure Spring Boot applications
- Creating and testing REST APIs
- Database integration using JPA and Hibernate
- Dependency management with Maven
- Layered backend architecture used in enterprise systems

**Purpose**
This project was completed as part of a Spring Boot backend development course to strengthen my skills in Java, REST APIs, and cloud-ready backend systems.
